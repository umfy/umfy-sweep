The default layer is colemak with backspace instead of ; 
It can be switched to qwerty on the firmware layer.
Most of the layers have combo assigned to them to lock them temporarily. When I want to use only number pad without holding the layer button i can press both opposite thumb keys while on that layer.

Arrow layer can be accessed via LayerTap by holding P. This makes deleting letters and tabulating possible with just one hand.
Left hand keys on lower row are inherited from the first layer which allows usage of shortcuts like ctrl+C and ctrl+V.

Number layer - zero might seem out of place but in fact it is the most used number so I placed it in the homerow. Brackets [ ] here allow fast typing of array indexes [0]

Symbol layer - most of the symbols on the top row are the same as the symbols placed under numbers on full size keyboard.

System layer - this is where all function keys and pc related shortcuts are placed.

Mouse layer is kind of symetrical for both hands.

Firmware layer - mainly for reseting the keyboard or changing to Qwerty
